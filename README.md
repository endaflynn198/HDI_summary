# Introduction
This library applies OOP principles to allow the easy summary and comparison of UN Human Development Indicators data. 

The UN Human Development Indicators dataset encompasses a broad range of data that reflect the multi-dimensional aspects of human development across countries. These indicators offer insights into the health, education levels, and economic status of different populations, providing a comprehensive understanding of global human development trends.
 

In RStudio, the package can be installed directly from GitHub using the following code:

```R
devtools::install_github("endaflynn198/HDI_summary")
library(HDIsummary)
```

For an overview of how to use the package, please see the vignette comparing Singapore and Nigeria [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/endaflynn198/HDI_summary/blob/main/vignettes/HDIsummary.html).

And note that you can find further information (and datasets on more countries other than those demonstrated in the vignette) on the UN Human Development Indicators [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/?organization=undp-human-development-reports-office&q=Human+Development+Indicators).
